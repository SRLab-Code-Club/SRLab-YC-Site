title: "Research Topics"
---
My research interests focus on applying multiple approaches, particularly **high-resolution Lidar-derived digital elevation models**, to better understand **the development of geologic structures and surface processes** that continuously shape the landscapes on Earth. The current four topics that I worked with my students range from **evolving landslide topography, effective 3D geologic mapping, landslide hazard modeling, and structural geology & tectonics**. The details of the research topics and recent leading contributions in papers are as follows:

## Topic I: Multi-period and multi-source high-resolution DEMs for studies of landslide and erosion processes.
**主題一：多期多源高解析度數值高程模型應用於山崩特性與侵蝕過程研究**  
Two representative papers for this topic are as follows:
