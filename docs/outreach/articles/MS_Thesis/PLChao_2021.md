title: "(M. Sc. Thesis) Improving Geologic Maps with LiDAR DEM: Yuli Coastal Range (2021)"
---
   
(Master thesis, 2021: Chao, Po-Lien) Using high-resolution DEM derived from LiDAR in Taiwan's Coastal Range, this study overcame challenges in geologic mapping caused by dense vegetation and steep terrain. The mapping method successfully identified features in both igneous and sedimentary rock, revealing new structures like shear zones, faults, and monoclines. The results, including a 1:50000 geologic map and profiles, showcase the potential of this approach for geological studies and engineering applications.
