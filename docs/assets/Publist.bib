ABSTRACT={The Fansipan and Tule mountain ranges, northern Vietnam, are regions with high elevations and are adjacent to the Red River Fault, which is an important structure that is related to the India-Eurasia collision. How mountain elevations are maintained today under a humid subtropical climate is important for improving the knowledge of the tectonic deformations in northern Vietnam and may have broader implications for the crustal dynamics of circum-Tibetan regions. We therefore utilized observations from field and digital elevation model (DEM) data and geomorphic analyses to constrain the active fault systems that have likely contributed to the uplift of mountain ranges. Our observations from DEM and field data indicate potential active normal and strike-slip faults such as the Phong Tho-Nam Pia Fault, Tule Fault, and Nghia Lo Fault. In addition to these observations, the results from geomorphic indices, which include both the stream-length gradient index (SL) and normalized steepness index (k<sub>sn</sub>), present high values for the footwalls of the inferred normal faults and low values for the hanging walls. Most of the identified knickpoints are related to the locations of mapped faults. Correlations of these data indicate that recent movements of the Fansipan and Tule mountain ranges are dominated by strike-slip and normal faulting under a NE-SW minimum extensional regime. We therefore propose that extensional tectonics associated with isostatic rebound likely plays a role in maintaining mountain elevations over long periods despite the continuous weathering and erosion present in monsoon-affected areas.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization and population growth in Hanoi city raise the demand for groundwater and the risk of land subsidence. This study is the first to conduct a long-term interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis with different SAR sensors including ALOS, COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 to evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of subsidence in Hanoi between 2007 and 2018. The results show that subsidence in Central Hanoi had been diminishing during these 12 years, while the southern and western outskirts (Ha Dong and Hoai Duc district) had become hot spots with peak rates of ~50 mm/yr. We further model the subsidence time-series with 22 years of piezometric records to estimate hydrogeological properties in the area. The modeling yields a mean consolidation coefficient of 0.56 m2/yr, a value typical for aquitards composed of >90% fine-grain materials. The model also predicts another 0.5–1.3 m of subsidence in Ha Dong by the end of this century. Based on these results, we propose zoning for subsidence susceptibility as the basis for future groundwater management in Hanoi. From a regional perspective, Hanoi is relatively less affected by land subsidence compared to other South East Asian cities due to geotechnical factors including small consolidation coefficients, as well as social factors such as lower population density.}

abstract={Geodetic evidence for slow slip recurrence changed by stress perturbations was rare, especially from afterslip following a nearby large earthquake. The first observed slow slip events in the southernmost Ryukyu subduction had occurred in 2005, 2009, and 2015 following the nearby 2002 March 31 Mw 7.1 Hualien offshore earthquake. To investigate whether the Mw 7.1 earthquake had influenced the occurrence times of the slow slip, we calculated the coseismic slip distribution and afterslip distribution using the surface displacements from onshore Global Navigation Satellite System observations. The stress perturbation on the slow-slip regions caused by the coseismic slip was quantified using the Coulomb failure criteria. We also examined the aftershock distribution and the evolution with time to clarify the stress perturbations from the afterslip offshore. Our results show that the primary afterslip distribution may have overlapped the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip patch at the downdip of the earthquake. The coseismic stress perturbation may have influenced the SSEs area directly by a Coulomb stress increase of probably 0.10 MPa. However, the 2005 SSE patch in the updip depths had only a little coseismic slip and afterslip with the Coulomb stress increase of approximately 0.06 MPa. We find that most of the aftershocks had occurred in the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip region that evolved into a typical aftershock sequence at least 2.5 years after the earthquake. The surface geodetic displacements reveal that the afterslip may have lasted longer than 4.5 years after the earthquake. The evidence for the afterslip proves that the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip patch was influenced by the afterslip directly for years. We suggest that the ongoing afterslip may have modulated the coseismic stress perturbation. It may explain the delay of the 2009 slow slip occurrence compared with the recurrence interval between the 2009 and 2015 slow slip events.},

abstract={A slow-moving landslide on the Huafan University campus, which is located on a dip slope in northern Taiwan, has been observed since 1990. However, reliable monitoring data are difficult to acquire after 2018 due to the lack of continuous maintenance of the field measurement equipment. In this study, the multitemporal interferometry (MTI) technique is applied with Sentinel-1 SAR images to monitor the slow-moving landslide from 2014–2019. The slow-moving areas detected by persistent scatterer (PS) pixels are consistent with the range of previous studies, which are based on in situ monitoring data and field surveys. According to the time series of the PS pixels, a long period gravity-induced deformation of the slow-moving landslide can be clearly observed. Moreover, a short period seasonal surface fluctuation of the slow-moving landslide, which has seldom been discussed before, can also be detected in this study. The seasonal surface fluctuation is in-phase with precipitation, which is inferred to be related to the geological and hydrological conditions of the study area. The MTI technique can compensate for the lack of surface displacement data, in this case, the Huafan University campus, and provide information for evaluating and monitoring slow-moving landslides for possible landslide early warning in the future.} }

abstract = {A natural hillslope developing into a landslide shows ground cracks and topographic deformation. Geomorphological and subsurface investigations using appropriate methodology are essential to understand the failure mechanisms and stability of a hillslope. Huafan University campus located on a dip slope in northern Taiwan is facing a potential landslide hazard. Slope movement was detected through the development of ground cracks and persistent deformation of campus buildings and facilities. To monitor the sliding behavior of the dip slope, a nail network consisting of 144 ground monitoring points was set in 2001, and its coordinates were measured using conventional traverse surveying twice a year until 2017. The 17-year surficial surveying results were presented as a time series of displacements with constraints of geometry and distribution of ground cracks and underground observations. The long-term surveying results reveal multiple potential sliding blocks within the Huafan University campus. A model of landslide movement with a listric sliding surface is proposed. Additionally, from the velocity field derived from the monitoring points, the horizontal strain rates of the slope are estimated. The pattern of strain rates indicates that a plausible fault passing through the campus may have affected the movement of the dip slope. The long-term surface monitoring of a potential landslide slope in this study provides a reliable and economical way to understand the mechanism of movement behavior of the slope and evaluate slope stability.}

abstract={Located in northern Vietnam, the Fansipan mountain range is the highest topography in the Indochina area. Until recently, there has been limited research regarding the tectonic deformation of the Fansipan mountain range and whether there are notable surface ruptures or active faults in the area. This study provides the first insight into the deformation patterns and potential active movements of the Fansipan mountain range, and may improve our understanding of the overall tectonic activities in northern Vietnam. Our observations from ASTER 30-m DEM show a symmetrical mountain form in the north and an asymmetrical form in the south. The analysis of river profiles indicates similar patterns on both sides in the north and different patterns in the south with short and steep rivers on the SW side and long and gentle rivers on the NE side. The results of the normalized steepness index (ksn) also show higher values on the SW side of the south part than the values from the other sides. These results suggest a spatial variation in rock uplift patterns of the Fansipan mountain range. Notably, the mountain front of the SW side of the southern Fansipan mountain range is associated with the Phong Tho-Nam Pia normal fault, suggesting that the normal faulting activity likely played an important role in tectonic uplift of this high mountain range. Our investigation of the stress field using fault kinematics indicates that the Fansipan mountain range and its surrounding areas are undergoing an inhomogeneous mixture of strike-slip and normal faulting. It is proposed that the strike-slip and normal motions alternated because of a permutation of $\sigma$1/$\sigma$2 under the same extensional stress regime of approximately NE--SW $\sigma$3. This kinematic pattern may effectively control the recent tectonic movements in northern Vietnam.},

abstract = {Abstract A significant issue in the study of orogenic systems concerns the roles played by frontal and basal accretion in the construction of orogenic wedges. These different accretion mechanisms result in different thermal histories, with underplated materials experiencing significant heating and deformation during tectonic burial. This work provides new thermal data from Raman spectroscopy of carbonaceous material in combination with structural and stratigraphic observations of the northern Taiwan slate belt to address these questions of wedge development. Sedimentary rocks of the Northern slate belt were deposited on the Chinese continental margin immediately before the onset of the Neogene Taiwan arc-continent collision. In the slates of the northern Hsüehshan Range, a large-scale pop-up structure on the prowedge of the Taiwan Orogen, synorogenic metamorphism has been investigated through analyses of peak temperatures and metamorphic field gradients. Results indicate underthrusting of the margin sediments to ~8-km depth with significant folding in two major duplexes occurring before underplating. Such basal accretion is considered responsible for the distinct culmination of the Hsüehshan Range in central Taiwan and its relative uplift with respect to the Backbone Range to the east along the Lishan Fault. A similar underthrusting scenario is also suggested for the Backbone Range Slate Belt. We propose that basal accretion is the predominant mechanism in the growth and evolution of the Taiwan orogenic wedge and may have been achieved through inversion of a graben system on the ancient passive margin during continental subduction.},

abstract = {Deep tectonic processes are key integral components in the evolution of mountain belts, while observations of their temporal development are generally obscured by thermal resetting, retrograde alteration and structural overprinting. Here we recorded an integrated rock time-temperature history for the first time in the pro-wedge part of the active Taiwan arc-continent collision starting from sedimentation through cleavage-forming state to its final exhumation. The integrated thermal and age results from the Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Material (RSCM) method, zircon U-Pb laser ablation dating, and in-situ 40Ar/39Ar laser microprobe dating suggest that the basal accretion process was crucial to the development of the Taiwanese orogenic wedge. The basal accretion process commenced early in the mountain building history (∼6 Ma) and gradually migrated to greater depths, as constrained by persistent plate convergence and cleavage formation under nearly isothermal state at similar depths until ∼ 2.5 Ma recorded in the early-accreted units. Such development essentially contributed to mountain root growth by the increased depth of the wedge detachment and the downward wedge thickening during the incipient to full collision stages in the Taiwan mountain belt.}

abstract = {Abstract Shallow slow slip events accompanied by seismicity has been increasingly reported in subduction zones during the last decade; however, the relationship between shallow slip events and seismicity is unclear. We report episodic slow slip events and seismicity at the southernmost Ryukyu Trench. The inversion results from GPS-derived cumulative displacements indicate that the slow slip events occur offshore in northeastern Taiwan on the shallow subduction interface, where high seismic VP/VS ratios applies. Seismicity is observed above the subduction interface for locations of significant variations in the VP/VS ratio and does not follow the migration of peak slip along the subduction interface. We calculated the temporal evolution between the seismicity and the propagation of slow slip events and determined that seismicity is not primarily driven by slip propagation. The spatiotemporal relationship, coupled with the VP/VS ratio, suggests that high-pressure fluid activity may be crucial to episodes of slow slip events and seismicity.},

abstract={Slope failure is a widely observed phenomenon in the mountainous areas in Taiwan due to rainy climatic and fragile geological conditions. Landslides easily occur after intense rainfall, especially from typhoons, and, accordingly, cause a great loss of human life and property. At the northern end of the Western Foothill belt in northern Taiwan, Huafan University is founded on a dip-slope about 20{\textdegree} toward the southwest composed of early Miocene alternations of sandstone and shale. Data from continuous monitoring using inclinometers and groundwater gauges reveal that 6--10 mm/month of slope creeping occurs, and a potential sliding surface is then detected about 10--40 m beneath the slope surface. To understand the potential runout process of the dip-slope failure at the campus, particle flow code 3D models based on a discrete element method are applied in this study. Results of the simulation reveal a critical value of the friction coefficient to be 0.13 and that more than 90{\%} of the campus buildings will slide down in 100 s when the friction coefficient is reduced to half the critical value. The weakening of the shear zone due to the rise of groundwater during rainstorms is assumed to be the main factor. Some suggestions for preventing landslide disasters are to construct catchpits to drain runoff and lower the groundwater table and to install a sufficient number of ground anchors and retaining walls to stabilize the slope.},

abstract = {Dip-slope mapping is a fundamental task for landslide investigation and mitigation. However, most dip-slope mapping methods involve visual interpretations and manual processes that are inevitably subjective and time consuming. The advent of high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) and increases in computing power have provided opportunities to improve the dip-slope mapping process. This study proposes a polygon auto-tracing method for generating dip-slope maps based on airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and a customized spatial analysis toolset developed in Python. This method requires the input of strata boundaries produced for sedimentary terrain based on 2m resolution LiDAR DEMs. The method begins by deriving the raster layer of the dip direction of the bedding, and it then executes a series of raster calculations among the three raster layers slope, aspect, and dip direction to extract the dip-slope raster cells. Using the clustering pattern of the dip-slope raster cells, we implement the Point-Density analysis tool to determine the dip-slope areas. The ArcGIS ModelBuilder platform is used to lay out an automated workflow for the proposed polygon auto-tracing method using the customized toolset. For demonstration purposes, we successfully mapped 298 dip slopes in the study area, which frequently experiences dip-slope landslides and is located in the sedimentary terrain of northern Taiwan. The dip-slope mapping results were compared and validated against two government-funded visually interpreted dip-slope maps. Our dip-slope mapping results were also used in a daylight analysis along major freeways to identify potential locations of daylighted dip slopes.}

    abstract = "{We study internal deformation of the Taiwan orogen, a young arc-continental collision belt, which the spatial heterogeneity remains unclear. We aim to ascertain heterogeneity of the orogenic crust in depth when specifying general mechanisms of the Taiwan orogeny. To reach this goal, we used updated data of continuous GPS (cGPS) and earthquake focal mechanisms to reassess geodetic strain-rate and seismic stress fields of Taiwan, respectively. We updated the both data sets from 1990 to 2015 to provide large amount of constraints on surficial and internal deformation of the crust for a better understanding. We estimated strain-rate tensors by calculating gradient tensors of cGPS station velocities in horizontal 0.1°-spacing grids via Delaunay triangulation. We determined stress tensors within a given horizontal and vertical grid cell of 0.1° and 10 km, respectively, by employing the spatial and temporal stress inversion. To minimize effects of the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi–Chi earthquake on trends of the strain and stress, we modified observational possible bias of the cGPS velocities after the earthquake and removed the first 15-month focal mechanisms within the fault rupture zone. We also calculated the Anderson fault parameter (Aϕ) based on stress ratios and rake angles to quantitatively describe tectonic regimes of Taiwan. By examining directions of seismic compressive axes and styles of faulting, our results indicate that internal deformation of the crust is presently heterogeneous in the horizontal and vertical spaces. Directions of the compressive axes are fan-shaped oriented between N10°W and N110°W in the western and mid-eastern Taiwan at the depths of 0–20 km and near parallel to orientations of geodetic compressional axes. The orientations agreed with predominantly reverse faulting in the western Taiwan at the same depth range, implying a brittle deformation regime against the Peikang Basement High. Orientations of the compressive axes most rotated counter-clockwise at the depths of 20–40 km, coinciding with transition of styles of faulting from reverse to strike-slip faulting along the depths as revealed by variation of the Aϕ values. The features indicate that internal deformation of the upper crust is primarily driven by the same compressional mechanism. It implies that geodetic strains could detect the deformation from surface down to a maximal depth of 20 km in most regimes of Taiwan. We find that heterogeneity in orientations of compressive axes and styles of faulting is strong in two regimes at the northern and southern Central Range, coinciding to areas of the orogenic thinned/thickened crust. Conversely, the heterogeneity is weak in the central Western Foothills at surrounding area of root of the overthickened crust. This observation, coupled with regional seismological observations, may imply that vertical deformation from crustal thickening and thinning and thinning-related dynamics from mantle flows may have joint influence on degree of stress heterogeneity.}",

abstract = {Mica porphyroblasts, a common metamorphic microstructure, are analyzed in the slate belt of northern Taiwan where large fish-like growths are found within a meta-pyroclastics. With constraints on the time-temperature history from deposition through peak metamorphic state to exhumation, in-situ 40Ar/39Ar laser microprobe dating was carried out on muscovite and corrensite fibers of mm-scale mica porphyroblasts grown on a pressure-solution seam. Because the peak metamorphic temperature and the porphyroblast formation condition (∼250 °C) remained far below the closure temperature of the K-Ar radioisotope system in muscovite, and the absence of muscovite in the mafic protolith, the dating results likely document the growth of the mica porphyroblast fabrics. The syn-kinematic nature of the analyzed porphyroblasts is confirmed by the ∼6 to ∼2.5 Ma growth ages, suggesting that the host rock was continuously deformed during the earlier two-thirds of the Taiwan Orogeny. The pattern of fiber growth, in contrast to outward-decreasing ages normally observed in peripheral recrystallization, appears random and resembles void fills in boudin openings. We postulate that syntaxial crack-seal following tensile micro-boudinage, along with slips on sub-grain boundaries, as a viable mechanism for the development of mica porphyroblasts and fish especially in lower-grade metamorphic rocks.}

abstract="We present a new compilation of magnetic, geologic, GPS and seismic data and propose that the geometry and kinematics of the Taiwan arc--continent collision are dominated by the partial subduction of a continental margin promontory and associated fracture zone. A prominent magnetic high in the pre-collision zone southwest of Taiwan serves as proxy for the edge of the continental crust of normal thickness (i.e., {\textasciitilde}30 km). The high ends abruptly in central Taiwan, suggesting truncation by a NW-striking fault zone interpreted as a rift-related transfer zone. The NW-striking fault zone correlates with a steeply dipping, crustal-scale cluster of earthquakes recognized as the Sanyi-Puli seismic zone, indicating reactivation of the transfer zone. The truncated anomaly and transfer zone define a triangular-shaped continental margin promontory partially subducted beneath Taiwan. Island-wide GPS data show: (1) divergent flow around the promontory; (2) significant shortening between the promontory and the arc in the central part of Taiwan; and (3) significant lateral extrusion of the orogen south of the promontory--arc collision. Collision of the relatively rigid promontory resulted in a tripartite division of the fold and thrust belt as it developed from about 2 Ma to present and the development of a recess or syntaxis in the central part of the Central Range. The syntaxis correlates with the highest topography, thickest crust and highest values of P-wave attenuation, suggesting that it may be an area of high rates of rock uplift and exhumation, consistent with other orogenic syntaxes recognized around the world. This interpretation is also consistent with geomorphic parameters from the central part of the Central Range that indicate high rates of uplift and with the absence of seismicity in this area. Although detailed thermochronologic and kinematic data are limited in central Taiwan, the available data suggest a recent increase in rates of exhumation consistent with the interpretation that the promontory collided relatively recently ({\textasciitilde}2 Ma).",

    abstract = "{ The regional-scale salients and recesses in the Appalachian orogen are well accepted as being a product of tectonic inheritance. Smaller map-view curves are present in the slate belt of the Taconic allochthon, which lies between the New York recess and Quebec salient, and we investigate the possibility that these curves are also related to the geometry of the preexisting Iapetan rift margin. The orientation of the slaty cleavage (S2) and mineral/stretching lineation (L2) and the geometry of syntectonic fibers were used to identify along-strike differences in the nature of the main stage of deformation (D2) in the slate belt. Where the axial traces of F2 folds lie parallel to the overall trend of the Taconic allochthon, the strata are characterized by an approximately downdip L2, plane strain, monoclinic strain symmetry, and top-to-west-northwest noncoaxial flow. The strata also underwent noncoaxial flow where the axial traces of F2 folds are oblique to the overall trend of the Taconic allochthon. However, L2 rakes moderately from the south on S2, and syntectonic fibers record evidence for flattening strain, triclinic strain symmetry, top-to-northwest shear in the XZ plane, and sinistral shear in the XY plane. We infer that the deformation zone in which D2 structures formed changed orientation along strike such that the region of obliquely oriented F2 folds underwent transpression, and we suggest that the transpressional deformation was a result of reactivation of a northwest-striking Iapetan transform fault as an oblique ramp during the Taconic orogeny. }",
